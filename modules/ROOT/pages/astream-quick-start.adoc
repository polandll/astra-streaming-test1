[#create-a-namespace]
== Create an Astra Streaming namespace

When Astra Streaming creates the new streaming tenant, it automatically creates a new namespace called *default*.
However, you can add a namespace:

. Click the *Namespaces* tab...
+
image::astream-new-namespace.png[New namespace]

. ... and click *Add Namespace*

. Enter a namespace name...
+
image::astream-name-namespace.png[Name the new namespace]

. ... and click *Save*.

Your namespace name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
It can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case).

[#create-a-topic]
== Create an Astra Streaming topic

With your tenant and namespace in place, you can now create a new topic:

. Click the *Topics* tab...
+
image::astream-new-topic.png[New topic]

. ... and click *Add Topic*

. Enter a topic name...
+
image::astream-name-topic.png[Name the new topic]

. ... and click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can leave *Persistent* and *Partitioned* at their default settings.
====

[#download-connect-info]
== Download Pulsar connection information

You'll need the following information to connect to your new Astra Streaming topic:

* *Broker Service URL*: The Pulsar Binary Protocol URL used for production and consumption of messages.
* *Web Service URL*: URL used for administrative operations.
* *Astra web token*: The JWT used for authentication in all Astra Streaming operations.

Astra Streaming let's you download a ready-to-go configuration file containing all of that information pre-populated, so let's download it now:

. Click the *Connect* tab...
+
image::astream-conf-download.png[Connection tab]

. ... and then click *Download Client.conf*
. Save the `client.conf` file to a convenient location.

[#download-pulsar]
== Download and configure Apache Pulsar command line tools

To interact with your Astra Streaming topic, you can use the command line tools included with the Apache Pulsar distribution.

Download and configure Apache Pulsar:

. Download the current binary of https://pulsar.apache.org/en/download[Apache Pulsar].
. Extract the Apache Pulsar zip file to a convenient directory.
. Copy the `client.conf` file you downloaded in <<Download Pulsar connection information>> and copy it to the `/conf` directory.

The Apache Pulsar command line tools are now configured and ready to use.

[#use-pulsar-tools]
== Use the Apache Pulsar command line tools

You can use the Apache Pulsar command line tools to easily interact with your Astra Streaming Pulsar instance. We'll take a look at the most useful commands in this section.

[NOTE]
====
You can find all of the Apache Pulsar command line utilities in the `/bin` directory within the Pulsar distribution.
====

[#get-instance-info]
=== Get information about your Astra Streaming Pulsar instance

Since you may not remember details about your Astra Streaming Pulsar instance, let's query some information using the `pulsar-admin` utility:

[TIP]
====
If you can't remember your tenant name, retrieve it from the Astra Streaming web console.
====

. Retrieve the namespaces associated with your tenant:
+
[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-admin namespaces list <tenant-name>
----
--
+
Result::
+
--
[source,plaintext]
----
"<tenant-name>/default"
----
--
====

. Retrieve the topics within a namespace:
+
[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-admin topics list <tenant-name>/default
----
--
+
Result::
+
--
[source,plaintext]
----
"persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>"
----
--
====

The URI, `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`, is what we'll use to
target a particular topic in the following sections.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following `pulsar-admin` sub commands don't work with Astra Streaming,
either because they're not applicable in a cloud environment or they would cause
issues with privacy or data integrity:

* `brokers`
* `broker-stats`
* `clusters`
* `ns-isolation-policies`
* `tenants`
* `resource-quotas`
====

For more information on `pulsar-admin` see the
Apache Pulsar http://pulsar.apache.org/tools/pulsar-admin/2.7.0-SNAPSHOT[documentation].

[#produce-some-messages]
=== Produce some messages for your topic

Let's begin by sending some messages to your Astra Streaming instance using
the `pulsar-client produce` command. You'll produce 100 `Hello world` messages:

[tabs]
====
shell command::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./pulsar-client produce -m "Hello world" -n 100 \

Notice that the content of the message outputs after the `----- got message -----`
line.

Of course, you created 100 messages, and consumed one, so that means there are
still 99 messages hanging around in the topic. We can specify the `-n 99` flag
to consume the remaining messages:

[#review-topic-statistics]
== Review messaging statistics for a topic

The Astra Streaming console reports on a variety of useful messaging statistics.
Let's create a new topic and use the `pulsar-perf` testing tool to generate some
synthetic messaging traffic.

[#create-a-new-statistics-topic]
=== Create a new topic

. Create a new topic following the instructions in <<Create an Astra Streaming topic>>.
. Click the topic name to open the statistics view:
+
image::astream-topic-details.png[Topic details]
. Copy the URI adjacent Topic Name to the clipboard:
+
image::astream-copy-topic-uri.png[Topic URI]

Set the topic statistics screen aside for now.
You'll refer back to it once you've got some message traffic flowing.

[#set-up-producer]
=== Set up a message producer

You'll use `pulsar-perf produce` to create some message traffic for your new topic.
In addition to the topic URI, the command specifies `-n 5` which creates `5` topic
producers. After a brief initialization and warm up period, `pulsar-perf`
will begin to publish messages.

Open a new terminal and, replacing `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`
with your own topic URI, enter:

[#set-up-consumer]
=== Set up a message consumer

Now that you're producing messages, you can create a process to consume them.
In addition to the topic URI, the command specifies `-n 5` which sets the number
of consumers to `5` as well as `-st Shared` which sets the subscription type
to `Shared` which is required if you want more than a single consumer for the topic.
As with the `produce` command, there will be a brief warm up and initialization
and the consumer will start consuming messages

Open a new terminal and, replacing `persistent://<tenant-name>/default/<topic-name>`
with your own topic URI, enter:

[#review-the-topic-statistics]
=== Review topic statistics

If you return to your topic details screen and refresh your browser, you'll now see statistics information for your new topic:

image::astream-topic-details-metrics.png[Topic statistics]

You can track the following statistics on this tab:

* *Data In*
** *Rate*: Sum of inbound (producer) messages per second
** *Bytes*: Sum of inbound (producer) message size in bytes
** *Throughput*: Sum of inbound (producer) message throughput in bytes per second
** *Messages*: Sum of inbound (producer) messages

* *Data Out*
** *Rate*: Sum of outbound (consumer) messages per second
** *Bytes*: Sum of outbound (consumer) message size in bytes
** *Throughput*: Sum of outbound (consumer) message throughput in bytes per second
** *Messages*: Sum of outbound (consumer) messages

* *Details*
** *Storage*: Disk space used to store messages in bytes
** *Producers*: Number of producers sending messages to the topic
** *Subscriptions*: Number of subscribers to the topic
** *Consumers*: Number of consumers retrieving messages from the topic
** *Backlog Size*: Disk space consumed by the message backlog in bytes
** *Avg Message Size*: Average size of each  inbound (producer)/outbound (consumer) message in bytes

// LLP: DON'T SEEM TO BE DISPLAYED IN UPDATE
//* *Offloaded Storage*: Amount of data offloaded to long term storage in bytes.
//* *Deduplication*: Indicates that deduplication is enabled or disabled for the topic.

==== Storage versus Backlog

The *Backlog* statistic represents messages that are stored in subscriptions for consumers.
As messages are consumed and acknowledged by consumers, they are removed from
the backlog.
When the backlog is 0, then all messages in the subscription have been acknowledged.

The *Storage* statistic, on the other hand, represents the total amount of messages
stored in the topic, including messages that are part of subscription backlog as
well as messages that are being retained for message replay.

[NOTE]
====
Stored messages that are no longer needed for replay or subscription backlogs are
not deleted immediately. Thus, the storage value on a topic can be greater than zero
even if message retention is disabled and there are no messages in subscription
backlogs.
====

[sidebar]
Anyone have any other useful observations? One thing I noticed is that sometimes
if a producer is terminated and the consumer is still running, the backlog will
drop to zero. Other times that doesn't happen.

//[#review-policies-statistics]
//=== Review policies statistics

[#review-subscription-statistics]
=== Review subscription statistics

Click the *Subscriptions* tab and you'll see aggregate statistics for the consumers
subscribed to your topics:

image::astream-sub-metrics.png[Subscription statistics]

You can track the following statistics on this tab:

* *Name*: Subscription name or prefix if there are multiple consumers for the subscription
* *Rate Out*: The rate messages are flowing outbound in messages per second
* *Throughput Out*: The outbound message throughput in bytes per second
* *Bytes Out*: Sum of the size of all outgoing messages in bytes
* *Message Count*: Sum of all outgoing messages
* *Redeliver*: Sum of redelivered messages
* *Type*: Type of subscription - Shared, Exclusive, Failover, or Key Shared
* *Consumers*: Number of subscription consumers

Click on the expand glyph on the left side of the subscription line and you can
view the messages in the subscription.
The four glyphs on the right side of the subscription line allow you to peek at
a message, go back to a message, skip forward through messages, and delete the
subscription.

image::astream-sub-glyph.png[Subscription statistics glyphs]

In the expand subscription view, you can track additional statistics on a per-consumer
basis:
