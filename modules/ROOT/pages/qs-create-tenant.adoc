[#create-a-tenant]
== Create an Astra Streaming tenant

Astra Streaming is based on Apache Pulsar which uses a concept of tenant as its
top level administrative unit.
A tenant has multiple namespaces for logical grouping of different applications.
In each namespace you can create multiple topics to send and receive data.
Your Astra Streaming account allows you to create a single Pulsar tenant
containing a maximum of two namespaces that can each contain multiple topics.

Let's begin by creating a new Astra Streaming tenant:

. Enter the name for your new streaming tenant and select a provider ...

. ... and click *Create Tenant*

Your tenant name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character.
It can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case).

Currently, only one region is available for each provider.
During the beta period, the billing plan is free.
