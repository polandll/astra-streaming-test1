= Astra Streaming sinks

Currently, two sinks are available for Astra Streaming:

* xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-sink[ElasticSearch]
* xref:astream-quick-start.adoc#create-a-sink[Astra DB]

The ElasticSearch sink pulls messages from Pulsar topics and persists the
messages to indexes.
The Astra DB sink pulls messages from Pulsar topics and inserts the data
in an Astra DB table.
